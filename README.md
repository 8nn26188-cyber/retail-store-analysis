## Project Overview

This project focuses on cleaning and analyzing a **dirty retail store sales datasets** to simulate a real-world data analyst workflow.

The dataset contains common data quality issues such as:
- Missing values
- Inconsistent data types
- Duplicate records
- Invalid or unrealistic values
- Inconsistent categorical labels

The goal of this project is **not predictive modeling**, but to demonstrate strong skills in:
- Data cleaning and validation
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Clear, explainable business insights
- Reproducible and well-structured analysis code

The project is designed as a **portfolio-ready data analytics project**, following industry-style practices such as:
- Separation of raw and processed data
- Script-based data pipelines (`src/`)
- Minimal, focused Jupyter notebooks for presentation
- Fully reproducible environment using `requirements.txt`
